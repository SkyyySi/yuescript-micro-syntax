# [Yuescript][yue] support for the [micro text editor][micro]

## Install

Just copy `yuescript.yaml` in `~/.config/micro/syntax/`. Alternatively, you can use a symlink. I'd recommend doing that, because then you can update by just updating this repo with `git pull` instead of manually replacing the file.

## Demo
